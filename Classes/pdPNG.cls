'Copyright 2018-2018 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 12/April/18
'Last updated: 23/April/18
'Last update: handle cHRM chunks (with the final corrections applied via LittleCMS)
'
'I have tried - *so* hard - to make 3rd-party PNG solutions work.  But they all suck.  Every last one of them.
' Like most standards attempts, PNG is an overcomplicated, hackish mess, and every library that attempts to
' wrap the format only makes things worse for developers.  (I mean, let's take LibPNG as an example.  It is
' the official PNG reference library, so it must be well-constructed, right?  It wouldn't do something asinine
' like implementing error-handling via setjmp/longjmp, would it?  Oh wait - it would?  @#$#$^@#$#^*^!!)
'
'After wasting dozens of hours fighting 3rd-party libraries, I gave up and wrote my own PNG parser.
' PhotoDemon needs fairly intricate access to PNG internals - during both reading and writing - and given
' the format's current ubiquity for images < 24-bpp, it makes sense to handle PNGs manually.  Since we ship
' zLib anyway due to legacy compression tasks, we have everything we need to do this, and it frees me from
' the nightmare of trying to make legacy C-libraries work with VB6.
'
'At present, this class only supports PNG importing.  Exporting is a WIP.  I may revisit the API design after
' finalizing export tasks.
'
'As of v7.2 nightly builds, this class *is* used as PD's primary PNG importer.  If you encounter bugs,
' please let me know so I can resolve them before 7.2 stable releases.
